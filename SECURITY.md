## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: All authentication is handled through Supabase with proper JWT implementation
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented throughout the application
3. **Data Protection**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **API Security**: All API endpoints are protected with proper authentication and rate limiting
5. **Dependencies**: Regular automated security audits of dependencies
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities

## Development Practices

1. All code changes must go through code review
2. Automated testing is required for all new features
3. Regular security training for all developers
4. Continuous monitoring of dependencies for vulnerabilities
5. Regular penetration testing
